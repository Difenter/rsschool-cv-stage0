## __About Me__
I am currently completing my 2nd year of university related to the profession of a programmer. 
The university shows different directions of the IT industry. For me, this was front-end development.

I started studying on my own and was looking for courses that would suit me. I love to learn new things,
I can sit for hours on end over the study, and then use my knowledge in development. 
Now my goal is to finish learning the basics and get a job as a junior front-end developer.

The input will be a non-negative integer._
```
function digital_root(n) {
  if (n > 9) {
    let arrStr = String(n).split('').map(item => Number(item));
    let result = arrStr.reduce((sum, current) => sum + current, 0);
